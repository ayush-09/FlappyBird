# FlappyBird
This repository contains the implementation of two OpenAI Gym environments for the Flappy Bird game. The implementation of the game's logic and graphics was based on the FlapPyBird project.<br>

### In this flappy.py file I train the Neural Network model with reinforcement learning approach.

## Train the Agent
 For train the agent uncomment the train function in the .py file.<br>
 if __name__ == '__main__':<br>
    &nbsp; agent = DQNAgent()<br>
    &nbsp; agent.train()<br>
    &nbsp; #agent.perform()<br>
